            <h1>Our History</h1>
            <p> The Womens Foundation was established in 2022 after a group of
                like-minded <br> women identified the need for an organisation that
                 would provide
                a voice for women <br>and girls  in RHC 
                Their primary objective was to tackle the challenges
                and inequities<br> that women and  girls face across RHC  society; a
                greater likelihood of being poorer and<br> lower paid, subject to 
                domestic violence,
                subject to prejudice in many industries,
                 and<br> less likely to  achieve senior
                positions in the workplace or in politics</p>
        </div>
        <div class=" miss">
            <h1>Our Principle</h1>

                the core principles of equality,
                 empowerment, diversity, collaboration,<br> and integrity.</p>
